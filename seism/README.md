Code package that implements the image segmentation measures and reproduces all results from the papers:

**Supervised Evaluation of Image Segmentation and Object Proposal Techniques**<br/>
Jordi Pont-Tuset and Ferran Marques, TPAMI 2015.

**Measures and Meta-Measures for the Supervised Evaluation of Image Segmentation**<br/>
Jordi Pont-Tuset and Ferran Marques, CVPR 2013.

The [project page](http://vision.ee.ethz.ch/~biwiproposals/seism/) contains updated evaluation, and browsable results from all techniques.

### Version history:
